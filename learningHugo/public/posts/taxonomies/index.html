<p>This page has tags and categories. Most Hugo themes ship with this. You can also create your own.</p>
<p>Moods is a custom taxonomy. It was custom made in the hugo.toml file. The format is singular = &ldquo;plural&rdquo;. EX: mood = &ldquo;moods&rdquo;.</p>

    <h3>Footer</h3>
    <p>All Single Pages will now have a footer! - I think we will use partials for this in the future...</p>
