const number = 5;
// You cannot change the value of a constant or reassign the constant.
console.log(number);

let score = 10;
score += 10;
console.log(score)
// You won't be allowed ot overwrite the let score later in the program
// Javascript doesn't care to much about spacing and indents, but I have been using standard practice of between operations
